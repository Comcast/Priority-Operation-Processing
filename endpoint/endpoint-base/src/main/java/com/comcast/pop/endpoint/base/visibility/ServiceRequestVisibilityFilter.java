/**
 * Usage example for CreateAgenda service call and looking up the insight....
 * On top of the Agenda.customerID to Insight visibility we need to make sure our service caller's
 * authorized
 * accounts
 * match the Insight.customerID.
 *  So, the following must be true:
 *  *
 *  * 1. The calling user has an authorized account a that matches the Insight.customerId
 *  * 2. The Agenda the caller is trying to create maps to an Insight where the above is true
 *  * 3. The Agenda can only map to an Insight if one of the following is true:
 *  *     Agenda.customerId is in the Insight.allowedCustomerList
 *  *     Insight.isGlobal is true
