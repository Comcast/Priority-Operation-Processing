/**
 * Source Streams Part
 * The Source Streams part decomposes the sources into the individual streams of content that will be transcoded and packaged in the subsequent parts.
 * In many cases, we know what streams our sources will contain, and then we explicitly define source streams for them.
 * In other cases, our customers may have variability in how provide they media content, and weâ€™ll rely on media analysis to determine what streams to create.
 * For example, a customer may provide videos with one or more audio tracks (each with a different audio language).
 * Source Streams are conceptual, meaning that describe what will be used as a transcoding/packaging source,
 * but there will not typically be a file on the file system that embodies this stream.
 * The Source Streams are grouped into the same categories as the Sources (Video, Audio, Text, Metadata).
