/**
 * The Output Streams part describes the needed transformations to create the streams that will
 * be assembled and packaged in the Outputs section. Each Source stream will be either left alone
 * (if itâ€™s going to be muxed into the Outputs) or used to create 1 or more derivative streams
 * (at different bitrates, resolutions, etc.)
 * Unlike source streams, each output stream is likely to correspond to a temporary file on the file system,
 * through demuxing video or audio from sources, or transcoding video or audio to produce a new intermediate file.
 * Each output stream defines the source stream that it is derived from and all of the transcoding
 * settings used to produce the new stream. These transcoding settings will vary, based on what codec
 * is used to in producing this output stream.
